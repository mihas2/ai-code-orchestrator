## Available Models

AI Code Orchestrator supports all Gemini models available through Google's API and automatically tracks Google's latest stable releases.

For the complete, up-to-date model list and capabilities, see [Google's Gemini models documentation](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini).

## Configuration in AI Code Orchestrator

1.  **Open AI Code Orchestrator Settings:** Click the gear icon (<Codicon name="gear" />) in the AI Code Orchestrator panel.
2.  **Select Provider:** Choose "Google Gemini" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3.  **Enter API Key:** Paste your Gemini API key into the "Gemini API Key" field.
4.  **Select Model:** Choose your desired Gemini model from the "Model" dropdown.

By default, AI Code Orchestrator selects a stable Pro model with a temperature of **1.0** where your provider supports it. This keeps suggestions more expressive and natural while still staying on task. If you need highly deterministic output (for example, for code generation in CI), you can lower the temperature toward `0.0`.

## Advanced Features

### URL Context

Gemini models can now access and analyze web content directly through URL context. This feature allows AI Code Orchestrator to:

- Read and understand web pages in real-time
- Analyze documentation from URLs
- Review online code repositories
- Access current information from websites

#### Enabling URL Context

1. Open AI Code Orchestrator Settings
2. Navigate to the Gemini provider settings
3. Enable "URL Context" option
4. Save your settings

#### Usage Example

```
Please analyze the documentation at https://example.com/api-docs and create a TypeScript client library based on the API specification.
```

### Google Search Grounding

Enable Google Search grounding to enhance Gemini's responses with real-time search results. This provides:

- Up-to-date information from web searches
- Fact-checking capabilities
- Current event awareness
- Enhanced accuracy for technical queries

#### Enabling Search Grounding

1. Open AI Code Orchestrator Settings
2. Navigate to the Gemini provider settings
3. Enable "Google Search Grounding" option
4. Save your settings

#### Usage Example

```
What are the latest best practices for React Server Components in 2025? Please search for the most recent information.
```

### Combined Usage

Both features can be used together for powerful workflows:

```
Search for the latest Node.js security vulnerabilities and then analyze my package.json file to see if I'm affected. Also check the official Node.js security page for recommendations.
```

## Tips and Notes

- **Pricing:** Gemini API usage is priced based on input and output tokens. URL context and search grounding may incur additional costs. Some experimental models are available for free. Refer to the [Gemini pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) for detailed information.
- **Model Selection:** Choose models based on your needs:
    - **Flash models:** Faster and more cost-effective for most tasks
    - **Pro models:** Better for complex reasoning and analysis
    - **Thinking models:** Best for tasks requiring step-by-step reasoning (requires reasoning budget)
    - **Experimental models:** Latest features, may be free but less stable
- **Context Windows:** Most Gemini models support large context windows up to 1,048,576 tokens, allowing for extensive code analysis and documentation processing.
- **Rate Limits:** URL context and search grounding features may have separate rate limits. Monitor your usage to avoid hitting limits.
- **Privacy:** When using URL context, be mindful of accessing private or sensitive URLs. Ensure you have permission to analyze the content.
- **Search Quality:** Google Search grounding works best with specific, well-formed queries. Be clear about what information you need.
