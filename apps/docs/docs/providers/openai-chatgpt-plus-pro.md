## Quickstart: Connect your subscription to AI Code Orchestrator

1. Open AI Code Orchestrator settings (click the gear icon <Codicon name="gear" /> in the AI Code Orchestrator panel).
2. In **API Provider**, select **OpenAI – ChatGPT Plus/Pro**.
3. Click **Sign in to OpenAI Codex**.
4. Finish the sign-in flow in your browser.
5. Back in AI Code Orchestrator settings, pick a model from the dropdown.
6. Save.

## Tips and Notes

- **Subscription Required:** You need an active ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscription. This provider won't work with free ChatGPT accounts. See [OpenAI's ChatGPT plans](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing) for more info.
- **No API Costs:** Usage through this provider counts against your ChatGPT subscription, not separately billed API usage.
- **Sign Out:** To disconnect, use the "Sign Out" button in the provider settings.

## What you can't do (and why)

- **You can't use arbitrary OpenAI API models.** This provider only exposes the models listed in AI Code Orchestrator's Codex model catalog.
- **You can't export/migrate your sign-in state with settings export.** OAuth tokens are stored in VS Code SecretStorage, which isn't included in AI Code Orchestrator's settings export.
